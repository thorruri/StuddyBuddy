## Project: Study Buddy

> We intend to build a tool that would be a solo place where students would be able to track the upcoming assignments, class tasks in an easy way . This tool allows students to even check for updates in the calendar about upcoming to-do lists, memo functionality. This tool will also provide the flexibility for the students to customize the look of the application based on their own choice of themes.

# Front-End: Build, Run and test

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in our browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
